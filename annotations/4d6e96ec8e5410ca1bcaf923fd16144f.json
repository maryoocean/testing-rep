Sopa de cape (clams soup) was more readily available and was made with one or more of the many varieties of shellfish found daily on the market. To prepare it, one would start with a stir-fry of oil, garlic, and parsley, remove the garlic as it browned, and add the desired amount of cape to the stir-fry. When these opened, they were poured with their cooking tocio (broth) into a bowl, in the bottom of which a layer of bread slices had been laid. A little hot beef broth was added, a grating of piasentin cheese and the dish was ready. Sopa de coa, i.e. beef tail soup, was prepared by boiling a skinned and chopped beef tail with celery, carrot and onion in a pot of salted water. When the broth was ready it was strained and poured into a tureen over slices of bread, with the usual grated cheese added.",
